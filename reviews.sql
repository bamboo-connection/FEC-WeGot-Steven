I thought it was pretty good. It was cooked pretty well, and the lemon wedge was really good with it, but I thought it could have used more seasoning or sauce of some sort. My mom makes rosemary lamb chops at home and I thought they were better. Don’t get me wrong, it was still good, but I would have rather had my mom make them because my mom is that good . The potatoes that came with it were delicious! We also go the pork belly app which was good. It had peaches on top which added a nice sweetness and I really enjoyed it. We also go the watermelon with feta on top. The watermelon was perfect in texture and in sweetness. The feta added a nice saltiness contrast to it. Since we had room for dessert, we got 2 of them to share. I loved the baklava. It had the perfect combination of flaky, sweet, nutty and sweet. We also got the birds nest dessert (not on menu) and it was pretty good except I wish it had been sweeter. Overall, it was a good meal with nice ambiance. The presentation of the dishes are beautifully plated as well.

I've never been to an Indian restaurant where rice wasn't served with the main dish (even if you ordered a dry dish), so it was irritating not only to have to wait an extra 5-10 minutes for a bowl of rice to come out, but to have to pay extra for something that is culturally standard for the food.

Sitting down the jazz was obnoxiously loud meaning the people sat across the walkway to me had to near-on scream at each other to be heard... meaning I had screaming couple vs overly loud jazz... Not a good start.
This restaurant also isn't the kind of place you sit down and enjoy a slow meal (which is my preference), it comes across more rushed and a more in'n'out kind of joint which came through in the service. Meal:
The steak was OK... I've had amazing steak and I've had good steak, this for me was just below the latter of the two with a lot of fat that could have been trimmed but wasn't.

They have a few tables on the side as you walk in, and they also have a small upstairs area. My only complaint is the price. For one chicken sandwich and a regular vanilla cone, it comes out to $15.

The last five occasions on visiting this franchise, the veggie add ons were quite skimpy, even when ordering a normal Veggie sub you would think they would pile it on since the vegetable garnishes are the main ingredients. It is possible that this is one of those franchises that protested bringing back the $4.99 foot long. So in order to economize losses, all the regular menu items have to be sub standard. I think this most recent visit will be my last visit to this particular Subway.

Then they only allow you to share potato and side dishes which may work out well for a number of you but when there's only two people and you don't like or want the same choices it bumps the price up to actually have what you want. They refused to do half potato half veg option! Why?? They're cooking the stuff anyway- a good restaurant would allow you to do that!! Had to order a share portion side of potatoes and veg which wasted a lot and everything was way too salty!! Adding salt to everything does not make it better! Cooking it to retain its natural flavours makes it good.

The atmosphere and service were phenomenal, and our group had a wonderful time there. That said, I have had some of the best meals of my life in places with zero atmosphere and service. For me, it's all about the food, so here's my analysis of the food at Quince. It all tasted wonderful and was cooked perfectly, but it over relied on two components that blunted the full force of the dishes, namely truffles and butter. Nearly every dish in our set course had truffles on it and was drowning in butter, which ended up dulling the cooking rather than allowing it to shine. I wish the chefs, who are obviously quite capable, were more committed to clean, honest flavors, especially with their earthy Italian cooking. That got me thinking about why the need for obvious decadence in every dish, and I can only guess that they're catering to the current, moneyed SF crowd. Make of it what you will.", "a week ago");

Fun game: put your broth mug next to your coffee mug and reach for one at random when you’re thirsty. You’ll be happy either way.
